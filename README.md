# Milkshakes!

Cookoutmilkshakereviews.com is a weird, intentionally irreverant, and poorly designed website that rates the most popular milkshakes at the Southern American fast food chain popular with people who have a limited budget and big appetite. 

## Background

Katie Quine and Andy Busam created this website in 2017 as a side project while working at Our State Magazine in Greensboro, NC. 

In the subsequent months and years, it has gained moderate interest from the small, but loyal, legion of Cook Out Milkshake fans. While readers periodically request new reviews to be added, the site creators have refrained. This is not out of spite, but sheer lack of time, priority, or willingness to learn how to use surge.sh again.
